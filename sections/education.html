        <p>Year 1 was all about building a foundation — we tackled programming fundamentals, object-oriented principles, and mathematical structures. It was a great intro to algorithms and learning how computers work at a low level.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="year-detail" id="year2">
        <p>Year 2 focused on software engineering, databases, and security. We worked on team projects, applied version control, and explored operating systems and system architecture in more depth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="year-detail" id="year3">
        <p>Final year was all about specialization. I dove into AI and machine learning, did a big final project, and got more into web development and data processing. Lots of research, independent work, and writing.</p>
